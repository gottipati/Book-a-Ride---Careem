Below are actions performed on application.

*  Customer will open car booking app.

*  App can automatically identify the customer location based on the gps(using geo location api of android or core location api of ios)
   or customer can enter his location manually. The request can be send to server using node.js. Node.js framework very useful for 
   persistent and reliable systems.
   
*  The driver locations are updated to back end server asynchronously using push mechanism(pub-sub systems) with time frame.

*  In real time the server will fetch nearest cabs based on customer location using shortest path algorithm or k-nearest neighbours 
   algorithm. And it will display early time arrival of the cab.
   
 I have implemented above back end solution in java using both Command pattern and simple facade pattern. Command pattern decouples an 
 object making a request from the one that knows how to perform it. Please find the class diagram in files. The facade pattern defines
 higher level interface to make subsystems easier to use.
 
 The SQS.java file can act as Queue for storing actual events running on back end. Each event can be considered as a command. For example
 BookCab.java, CancelCab.java, NearestCabs.java are actual commands. BookARide.java can act as a simple facade for defining higher level
 functionality of the system. We can use multiple design solutions based on the requirements.
   
 Below are the challenges we have to address by designing this system for large scale:
 1) How to handle thousands of customer requests with accurate real time information of cabs location?
 
 2) How we scale the data base with such large amonts of data?
 
 3) How to handle multiple events like payment, driver locations and customer locations parallely? 
 
 4) How to route requests to specific server based on customer location?
 
 5) How to handle parallel requests of booking a cab and payment if any one of the event fails to reach the server end?
 
 
 Below are the design solutions for the above challenges.
 
 1) At any given point of time we have driver data with their locaitons ids (driver_id, location). The server can maintain location based
    data based on geography and region. Based on the customer location it can request the nearest location server to return the nearest 
    driver locations with early time arrival.
    
 2) We can partition the data based on the region based and store it in multiple data base systems like horizontal scaling. Either we
    can design this solution using master-slave or no-master like amazon dynamo db. 
    
 3) We can use caching on data base for efficient and real time processing. For this we can either use redis or memcached. For multiple event
    handling we can create a queue like amazon SQS using command pattern and route the requests to specific services using observer pattern.
    
 4) We can use load balancer like haProxy or nginx to route the requests to specific server and can able to handle users based on geograpy
    and region.
   
 5) We need to provide a strict persistent mechanism to handle multiple events on data base for accurate data update.
 
 We can separately create a data access layer(persistent layer) to handle all the updates related to data base. So that the business or application
 logic does not depend on any particular data base.
 
 We can use no-sql like cassandra for speedup read requests and real time processing from data base.
